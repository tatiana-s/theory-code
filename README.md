# Theory Visualiser
Code dealing with concepts from theorethical computer science such as formal languages and finite automata.

## Development ideas
- Grammar Parser
  - Generating random words 
  - Determining type of language
  - generalsing types of words that can be made?
  - checking if word is part of language
  - syntax trees
- Automata Visualiser
  - drawing graph given a described automata (own algorithms)
  - minimizing automata
  - graph interactive tool box
  - checking if word is accepted
  - converting grammar to automata and vice versa
- Presentation
  - explanation and examples in Jupyter notebook
  - JavaScript website
